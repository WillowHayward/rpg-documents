Read the following to the players

\begin{DndReadAloud}
You are the Knights of Carith, a group of adventurers based out of the city of Carith. Working together, you keep her safe and free from evil - but today, it is one of your own that needs saving.

Markus “The Spider” Pelanto, corrupt leader of the local adventurers guild, has taken your leader, <leader> captive, and it’s on to the four of you to save them.

Your good reputation and a few gold pieces have led you to the hideout where <leader> is being held. You all stand on a quiet street in the middle of Carith.
\end{DndReadAloud}

<5 You are standing in a quiet street with seemingly identical townhouses filling it end to end. The party stands before the one that they were directed to by their contact.

5-9 The townhouse in front of you is almost imperceptibly nicer than the surrounding doors. It is well maintained and even polished, a sign of the wealth within.

>9 There’s a small wooden panel in the middle of the door that looks like it pulls back.

The door leads to 2. Entrance.
